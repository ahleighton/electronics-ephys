Charge: Charged particles exert electric force
****************************************************************************
A particle is charged if it can exert an electric force on another charged particle. The direction of the force depends on the polarity of the involved charges; if they are both positive or both negative, the charges will repel each other. If they have opposite polarities, the force will be directed towards each other. If the charges are larger or closer together, the force will be bigger. This relationship is described in Coulomb’s law:

.. math::

  F= k\frac{q1q2}{r^2}

  .. raw:: html

    <center><b>Equation 1: F = electric force, k = Coulomb constant, q1 + q2 = charges, r = distance of separation.</b></center>

.. figure:: ../static/images/coulombs_law_visual.png

  **The magnitude of electric force between charges depends on their charge and the distance between them.**


We often represent electric force using electric field lines, such as those radiating out from the particle in Fig 2 below. Field lines indicate the direction of force that would be experienced by a ‘test charge’ if we placed it at that point. This test charge is by convention a unit positive charge, i.e. a charge with value +1. The lines in the figure below therefore point away from the centre charge, as the positive test charge would experience a repelling force. The density of lines indicates the magnitude of the force, decreasing with distance from the charge.

Electric field lines show the direction of the force on a positive charge. Colour intensity represents electric potential.

  **Electric field lines show the direction of the force on a positive charge. Colour intensity represents electric potential.**


Current: Currents are moving charged particles
****************************************************************************

When charged particles move, this creates a current (I) which can be measured in amperes. The current tells us how much charge is moving per second.

.. math::  I = \frac{Q}{t}

.. raw:: html

  <center><b>Current (I) is equal to charge (Q) over time (t).</b></center>

By convention, the direction of this current is always the direction of positive charge movement. In Neuroscience, currents are indeed often carried by positively charged ions such as sodium and potassium. However in most other cases in electronics, negatively charged electrons in metals are the actual charge carriers. When currents are generated by electronics or a negatively charged ion, such as chloride, we describe them as a positive current moving in the opposite direction.

Electric Potential Difference
****************************************************************************

The figure below shows a negative and positive charge that are held in a certain position in space. These large charges are not allowed to move (they have a large mechanical force restraining them), but they still exert an attracting force on each other. If we let them, they would move towards each other. If we were to place our test charge anywhere in this space, it would experience a net electric force; some influence from the + charge, some influence from the negative charge. The vector description of the magnitude and direction of that force is the electric field, and is shown as field lines below.

.. figure:: ../static/images/electric_potential.png

  A large positive charge and a smaller negative charge held in space, with electric field lines indicating electric force and direction and electric potential represented in colour.


Each point in this image has a value that describes the electric potential at that point, represented by colour. The electric potential is different to the electric field. While the electric field has both magnitude and direction, the electric potential only has magnitude, and is represented as colour in this figure. High, (orange) positive electric potential surrounds our positive charge, and low (blue) negative potential surrounds our negative charge.

The electric potential of a point tells us how much work energy we would need to provide in order to move a +1 test charge from an electrically neutral position (a place with 0 electric potential) to that point. To move a +1 charge from a neutral place towards the large positive charge would require a lot of energy, because we would need to overcome the repelling force between the two positive charges. In contrast, moving the test charge from a neutral position towards the negative charge will actually provide energy, as the two are attracted to each other. This release of energy is indicated by a negative electric potential.

The ‘map’ of electric potential in this figure will therefore tell us what would happen to an unrestrained test charge placed anywhere in this space. If we placed our positive +1 test charge at an area of high potential, like point ‘A’, it would follow the gradient of the electric potential until it reached the negative particle at point ‘B’. The difference in electric potential between point A and B therefore generates a current (a moving charge). We could use that converted potential energy to power something else.

In contrast, to move the same particle from point B to point A, we would need to provide additional energy to counteract the repelling force generated by the positive point charge. The difference in electric potential between two points tells us how much energy we need to move a charge from one place to another. If we were to add more point charges (that are not allowed to move) to this image, their generated forces will sum, giving a more complex map of electric potentials at every point in space.

An old-fashioned but helpful term for electric potential difference is electric drive or ‘pressure’; just as a difference in gravitational potential energy can cause a river to flow down a mountain, a difference in electric potential can cause charged particles to flow from a high electric potential towards lower electric potential.

The bigger the difference in electric potential between A and B, the higher the driving force on the charges. If there is no difference in electric potential, no net charges will move (no current). The driving force in an electric circuit is therefore the Electric Potential Difference between two points, measured in volts and often referred to as ‘voltage’.

Because the definition of electric potential is the work energy required to move charge from a neutral point to that location, the electric potential must always be described relative to that neutral point. The electric potential difference between two points can be given; point A in the above figure may be +50V and B could be -10V. These values are always relative to our neutral point at 0V, there is no such thing as an absolute electric potential of a point.

When a circuit is connected to a source of electric potential difference, such as a battery (with 5V at one end and 0V at the other), current will start to move from the 5V + terminal to the 0V neutral point.
Where is 0 volts?
To describe the height of a mountain, there is no such thing as absolute altitude; instead, we use ‘sea level’ as our point 0 and measure from there. A similar thing goes for voltage. We pick a point to call ‘0 V’ and compare the rest of the circuit to that. This point can be the negative terminal of a battery, the extracellular fluid, or a point at infinity, far from all sources of electric potential (Einevoll et al., 2013).

The terms ‘ground’, ‘reference’, and ‘earth’ are often used interchangeably, but are not quite the same thing.

- **Reference**: A point in the circuit that you labelled 0V, so that you can measure the other values from there.
- **Ground**: Often used as a reference point and considered 0V, but has the additional capacity to provide (source) or get rid of (sink) a lot of current, without its own potential changing.
- **Earth**: The actual planet earth is the best ground we have. Metal poles in the earth are used to sink current from lightning bolts because the sheer size of the earth means that such a tiny bit of extra current is not a problem, and won’t change the potential of the earth.

Forces interact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As mentioned above, the actual result of an electric force on a charged particle will depend on all the forces affecting the particle, including mechanical and chemical influences. The relative magnitude and direction of all these forces will determine whether and where a particle moves. For instance, a free ion in the cytoplasm will more easily be pushed by an electric force than a particle bound to a membrane. Similarly, an ion will have to experience considerable electric force to go against its concentration gradient and move towards a region with a high concentration of that ion. Only when the electric force has become larger than the repelling chemical force will the ion actually move (see section on the membrane potential below).

Resistance opposes current flow
****************************************************************************

Whereas electric potential difference drives the flow of current, resistance opposes current flow. A resistance can be measured between any two points A and B; it may be so high as to be infinite in which case we consider the points isolated from each other. The resistance may be very low, such as in a wire, in which case we consider the two points short circuited. Resistors are circuit components that are designed to provide a specific amount of opposition to the flow of current.
The electric potential difference (V) drives a current (I) from point A to B across a resistance (R). This is described by Ohm’s law:

.. math::

  I=V/R

.. raw:: html

  <center><b>Equation 3: Current (I) is equal to voltage (V) over resistance (R). </center></b>

Capacitors separate charges by polarity
****************************************************************************

Capacitors for use in electronics are made of two conducting plates, separated by a thin layer of insulating material that prevents the plates from touching. When a capacitor is in a circuit connected to a voltage source, such as a battery, current will flow through the circuit as the high electric potential at the positive terminal of the battery provides electric force. The charges that make up the current flow cannot move through the insulating layer of the capacitor, so the charges collect on one of the plates. The assembling charges exert an electric force which can cross the insulating layer, repelling identically charged particles on the opposite plate and pushing them along the circuit. This allows current to flow through a circuit containing a capacitor, even if an individual charge never crosses between the capacitor plates.
As positive charges accumulate on one plate, and negative charges on the other, the plates become more and more ‘charged’. To continue charging the plates, the battery must provide enough energy to overcome the repelling force of the charged plates, and to continue adding charges of the same polarity. This becomes more and more difficult until eventually, the repelling force of the ‘charged’ capacitor plates will become stronger than the battery. At this point, the capacitor is fully charged by that battery.

.. math::

    Q=C∗V

.. raw:: html

  <center><b>Equation 4: The amount of charge (Q) a capacitor can separate depends on is its capacitance (C, measured in farads) and the voltage (V) across the capacitor. </center></b>


An uncharged capacitor has no net charge on either plate (left). A charged capacitor separates charges with positive charges on one plate, and negative charges on the other (right).
In a direct current circuit, current will flow while the capacitor charges, as charge is pushed or pulled on either plate. Current flow will stop once the capacitor is fully charged. This electric charge can be discharged (and, for instance, used to power something) by providing a path that connects the positive and negative charges of the capacitor.

AC and DC
****************************************************************************

Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) are used to describe two different kinds of signals. In circuits supplied by direct current, the charge carriers flow in one direction from the voltage supply. The most common example of this is a circuit powered by a battery.

AC means that the voltage supply is changing polarity, and that the charge carriers are actually flowing back and forth, alternating current direction at a specific frequency. Energy is provided by there being current flow, independent of the direction.

.. figure:: ../static/images/AC_DC.png

  Left; A DC voltage source in a circuit is represented by one short and one longer line, and outputs a steady voltage. Right: an alternating voltage source is represented by a sine wave inside a circle, and outputs a signal that alternates between voltages, such that the direction of current changes.


Frequencies
****************************************************************************

Frequency is measured in the unit Hertz, which is the number of full wavelengths/second. High frequency signals have many peaks and troughs in a second, and low frequency signals have few. It can sometimes be helpful to think of constant voltages as the lowest possible frequency signals.

The power supplied to your lab or home is an alternating current that changes polarity 50 or 60 times a second, depending on which country you are in. An action potential is also an alternating signal, as a positive current travels in both directions across the cell membrane during a complete action potential. As an action potential takes around 1 ms, action potentials have a frequency of around 1KHz.

Oscillations of multiple frequencies from different sources can combine and create complex looking signals that contain relative quantities of different frequencies. Filters can extract frequencies of interest, reducing the amplitude of other, unwanted frequencies.

Impedance
****************************************************************************

We previously used the term resistance (R) to describe opposition to steady current flow. This is sufficient to describe circuits supplied by a direct current. However, in alternating current circuits, current flow changes. The opposition to that change is described by the term Reactance. To describe opposition to current in circuits supplied by alternating signals, we therefore have to use the term ‘Impedance (Z)’, which captures both resistance and reactance.
The impedance measurement is frequency-specific. We can measure the impedance of a circuit component at different frequencies, so that we understand both the magnitude and phase relationship between V and I over a broad frequency range (from 1 Hz to 10 kHz). Resistors and capacitors will respond differently to changing the frequency of an applied sinusoidal voltage (an alternating signal):

Impedance: Resistors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For resistors, the impedance magnitude (Z) is constant and does not vary with the frequency of signal applied. The impedance follows Ohm’s Law (V = IR), which doesn’t take the frequency of the signal into account. Resistors are not affected by changes in current flow.

Impedance: Capacitors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In contrast, for a capacitor, the magnitude of impedance decreases as the frequency increases (see Eq 5). We can therefore only describe the impedance of a capacitor at a specific frequency. A second component of impedance is phase offset; in capacitors, the current is 90° out of phase with the voltage. This second aspect of impedance is not within the scope of this piece.

.. math::

  Zc = \frac{1}{2 \pi fC}

.. raw:: html

  <center><b>Equation 5: The magnitude of impedance of a capacitor (Zc) will decrease with increasing frequency (f). The larger the capacitance (C), the lower the impedance at a specific frequency.</b></center>

Circuits
****************************************************************************
Current
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The current flowing into a point in a circuit must be the same as the current flowing out of it. Therefore, if a wire branches into two wires, the current must be divided over the branches. The amount of current in a branch is determined by the total amount of impedance in that branch, where I = V/Z.

Voltage Dividers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The relative impedances of circuit components, determines the voltage at each point in the circuit. As described above, electric potential difference (or ‘voltage’) is always measured relative to a point that we consider 0V. For a battery, that 0V point is the negative terminal.
In a circuit powered by a 9V battery, all 9V of potential from the positive terminal of the battery must be converted to different forms of energy (such as heat or light) in order to return to 0V at the negative terminal of the battery. If there is a single resistor in the circuit, all 9 V will drop ‘over’ that resistor. If there are multiple components in the circuit, the voltage dropped over each component will follow the ratio of their impedances, always resulting in 9V in total.
In each circuit below, the current through R1 must equal the current through R2, as there is nowhere else for the charges to go. The total voltage drop over the circuit must equal the total provided voltage. Following Ohm’s law, and given that they experience the same current, a higher resistor will have a higher voltage drop (V=IR).

.. figure:: ../static/images/voltage_divider.png



Therefore, in a circuit with multiple resistors in series, the ratio of their resistances determines how much voltage will drop over each. We can therefore split up (divide) the voltage from a source across resistors to produce an output voltage Vout:

.. math::

  Vout = Vin \frac{R2}{R1+R2}

Why is this useful? If we place a multimeter at Vout, we can decide exactly which voltage we want to see there. If we had a piece of equipment that would be damaged by voltages over 3V, we could safely power that with a 5V power supply and a voltage divider giving a stable 3V Vout.
In another example, if we wanted to know the value of Vin by measuring Vout, we would make R2 as large as possible, so that the value of Vout and Vin were as similar as we could make them. This is what we do in electrophysiology acquisition systems, where we can never directly measure the voltage at a point in the brain, but can infer it from a second point further in the circuit.

RC Filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As mentioned above, to filter a signal means to try to get rid of certain frequencies (or at least greatly reduce their amplitude) without affecting the amplitude of frequencies of interest.

Low-pass filters allow low-frequency signals to ‘pass’ and are designed to reduce the amplitude of high-frequency signals.
High-pass filters do the opposite, blocking low-frequency signals.
Bandpass filters combine low- and high-pass filters to extract frequencies in a specific range of interest.

Analog filters can be built out of basic electronic components. To build a filter, we need:

- A way of diverting ‘unwanted’ signals out of our circuit.
- A component that provides high impedance to the frequencies you want to get rid of, and low impedance to the frequencies you want to keep.

Because the impedance of a capacitor is frequency-dependent, they are ideal candidates for analog filters. The second crucial element is a voltage divider to ground.

.. figure:: ../static/images/analog_filter.png


At unwanted frequencies, the filter must provide very low impedance Z2 to ground, so that almost all the voltage is lost over Z1 and the amplitude at Vfiltered is very low. At desired frequencies, Z2 must be very high impedance, so that it requires a high voltage drop and a corresponding high amplitude at Vfiltered.



High-pass RC filter
---------------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: ../static/images/analog_filter_high.png


Capacitors provide high impedance to low frequencies. At low frequencies, this voltage divider will therefore have a high Z1 and a relatively low Z2, so most voltage will be lost before the signal reaches Vfiltered. If the frequency is high, Z1 will be low and most of the voltage amplitude will be maintained at Vfiltered.

Low-pass RC filter
---------------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: ../static/images/analog_filter_low.png


Capacitors provide high impedance to low frequencies. At low frequencies, this voltage divider will therefore have a low Z1 and a relatively high Z2. Most of the signal amplitude will be maintained at Vfiltered. If the frequency is high, Z1 will be high and the signal amplitude will be attenuated at Vfiltered.

Why does the impedance of a capacitor vary with frequency?
---------------------------------------------------------------
The higher the frequency of the signal, the faster the capacitor will switch between charging and discharging. Initial (dis)charging happens very quickly, and the rate of (dis)charging of a capacitor slows exponentially with time (in a simple battery-powered circuit). Therefore, the quicker the change between charging and discharging, the more current will flow in the circuit; the capacitor provides low impedance.


.. figure:: ../static/images/charging_discharging_cap.png


At slow frequencies, the plates will be able to separate more charge before the switch in polarity occurs. The driving force of the accumulated charge on the plate will work against the driving voltage and slow down the current; the capacitor charging rate will move into the slower tail of the curve with reduced current and subsequently higher impedance.

Analog and Digital Signals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Say you measure a signal, and find it is producing a sine wave with an amplitude of 5V at a frequency of 3 Hz.

You now want to send a description of this signal to a second machine. You have two options: analog or digital communication. Both analog and digital signals are propagated through wires by the movement of electrons.

Analog
---------------------------------------------------------------

Analog signals are sent by directly replicating the values you measured at each time point.  In this case, you would be varying the voltage over the wire to re-create a 10Hz 5V sine wave. The resolution with which the original signal is replicated is important; if many time points are represented, the receiver will have a much better image of the original signal than if only a few time points are sent.

Digital
---------------------------------------------------------------

In digital representations, only 2 voltages are used to represent the same signal. For example, if we could only send a 3V signal or a 0V signal, how would we encode the same sinewave as above?

We can do that by sending signals where 0 is represented by 0V, and 1 is represented by 3V. If we send one signal (one bit), we can represent 2 numbers. By sending multiple signals in a term (called ‘binary words’) the number of values we can communicate increases exponentially; with 8 numbers, we can represent 256 different values. This can be used to send the numbers 0 - 255, using only 2 voltages. The more values in a binary word, the more values can be represented. This can also be called ‘bit depth’.

This system requires that the sender can convert analog to digital values (analog to digital converters are often abbreviated to ADCs) and it requires an agreement between the sender and receiver in terms of content such as the duration of each pulse and the number of bits in a binary word.


.. figure:: ../static/images/analog_digital.png


Dealing with Noise
---------------------------------------------------------------

At first glance, analog signals may seem superior, as our goal is to get a precise copy of the original signal. However, digital information transfer has many advantages. In fact, electrophysiology signals are digitized as quickly after detection as possible, on the headstage. One reason for this is that digital signals are more resistant to noise. ‘Noise’ is the term used to describe electrical signals that we did not intend to pick up, such as the 50/60 hz mains supply frequency.

If a cable transmitting analog data encounters noise (e.g. 50 hz), this noise is added directly to the signal, and will appear in the final output of the system. If the same happens to a cable transmitting a digital signal, noise will still be added to the voltage. However, because the receiver can only encode whether the voltage was ‘high’ or ‘low’, the noise gets abstracted out and the signal is read as clearly as if there had not been noise on the cable.

Electronics in the brain
##########################################################

The electrical circuits described above are made up of voltage supplies, wires, and resistive and capacitive components. We can draw parallels between these components and parts of electrically active tissues, such as the brain, muscles, and heart. Just like the electrons in metal wires, these tissues contain charged particles that will move in response to electric potential differences. A positively charged particle will flow towards a place with lower electric potential, whether that is the negative terminal of a battery or the negative potential inside a neuron. Additionally, biological tissues or fluids can provide high or low electrical resistance, and Ohm’s law holds across these resistances just as it would in a circuit made of wires. Considering the electronic properties of each part of the neuron allows us to abstract away biological details and focus on the driving forces and current opposition faced by charges in that environment.

Electronic equivalents
**********************************************************
Charge carriers: ions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In metal wires, negatively charged electrons are the charge carriers. In neurons, the charge carriers are ions, primarily Na+, K+, Cl- and Ca2+. The flow of these particles constitutes a current.

Voltage source: membrane potential
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The driving force in this scenario is the membrane potential, i.e. the difference in electric potential between the inside of a cell and the extracellular fluid. A neuron typically has a resting membrane potential of around -70 mV compared to the extracellular fluid, if we label that the extracellular fluid as 0V.

Impedance: cell membrane permeability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Because the largest electric potential difference is across the cell membrane, the greatest potential for current flow is across this membrane. The opposition to current flow in the brain is largely determined by the permeability of the cell membrane to ions. If there were no ion channels in the membrane, it would have an extremely high impedance. Impedance can be lowered by opening ion channels in the membrane, allowing charge to flow across the membrane through these channels. Because ion channels only allow passage of specific ionic species, the neuron is able to adjust impedance separately for each ion- impedance for K+ can be lower than that for Na+. This powerful ability is essential in maintaining the negative internal electric potential of the cell (see below).

How is the membrane potential maintained?
-----------------------------------------------------------
This membrane potential has to be actively maintained by the neuron, by pumping Na+ out of the cell, and pumping K+ in. This creates a concentration of K+ around 30 times higher inside the cell than in the extracellular fluid. In contrast, the concentration of Na+ is around 10 times higher outside the cell than inside. This is in itself not enough to create a charge imbalance; though there are more K+ ions inside the cell, these ions will be largely bound to negative species (for instance, Cl- to create NaCl and KCl) so that both the internal and external solution will be electrically neutral.
The cell membrane contains many different species of K+ ion channels, allowing K+ to cross the cell membrane and making the impedance of the cell membrane to K+ (at rest) relatively low compared to the impedance to Na+ or other ion species. In which direction will K+ flow? Ions will tend to diffuse away from areas where there is a high concentration of the ion, to areas with a lower concentration. The high concentration of K+ inside the cell creates an outward driving force, pushing K+ to leave the cell. However, each time K+ does leave the cell, it leaves behind a negatively charged species such as Cl-, creating a very local polarisation where the inside of the cell becomes more negatively charged than the outside. This creates a second driving force on the positive K+ ion, pulling K+ back into the cell.
K+ ions are therefore influenced by an electrical driving force into the cell, and a chemical driving force out of the cell. When one is larger than the other, a net current of K+ will flow through ion channels, reducing the dominant driving force, until the electrochemical forces are balanced. At that point, though K+ will enter and leave the cell, there is no net flow of K+ across the cell membrane.
When are these forces balanced? This is described by the Nernst equation, which calculates the ‘equilibrium potential’; the electric potential difference which must exist across the cell membrane to balance the driving force of the concentration gradient at specific concentrations.


.. math::

    V_{K} \approx -60 mV\;log_{10} \frac{[K]_{in}}{[K]_{out}}


For a situation in which there is 30 times as much K+ inside the cell as out, this outward driving force will be balanced by an internal electrical driving force if the cell is around -90 mV more negative than the extracellular fluid.
This is the main contributor to the -70mV resting potential of the neuron. The actual membrane potential is slightly less negative because it is determined by the equilibrium potential of the other ions too. The influence of each ion’s equilibrium potential upon  the final resting membrane potential is determined by the permeability of the membrane to that ion. This is represented by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz Constant Field equation:

.. math::

    V_{m} \approx -60 mV\;log_{10} \frac{P_K[K]_{in} + P_{Na}[Na]_{in} + P_{Cl}[Cl]_{out}}{P_K[K]_{out} + P_{Na}[Na]_{out} + P_{Cl}[Cl]_{in}}


Here P is the permeability of the membrane for each ion. The lower the impedance to an ion, the higher the permeability, and the more that ion will influence the membrane potential. For further reading, including an estimation of the actual number of ions crossing the membrane (fewer than you might think) please read `this excellent refresher by Stephen Wright. <https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/advan.00029.2004>`_

Capacitance: cell membrane
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The definition of a capacitor was described above as two conducting plates separated by a thin, insulating layer. This configuration does not occur only in specifically designed electronics components. One example of a capacitor in biology is the neuron, where both the intracellular and extracellular medium are conductive, but the cell membrane is not. The cell membrane is therefore also a capacitor, and charge can be separated along the membrane depending on the potential difference between the inside and the outside of the cell. We often say that the cell membrane is ‘like’ a capacitor, but it is important to acknowledge that charged particles can’t tell the difference between a neuronal membrane or a capacitor you ordered online; they will obey the electrical driving forces in both cases. The cell membrane is a capacitor.

.. math::

  Q = C * V

The amount of charge (Q) a capacitor can separate depends on its capacitance (C, measured in farads) and the voltage (V) across the capacitor. At resting membrane potential there is a 70mV difference across the membrane, allowing the separation of positive and negative charges. When the cell depolarises, the voltage across the cell membrane is reduced. Now that V is smaller, the ability for the membrane to separate charge (Q) is also reduced. Charges that were previously held along the cell membrane are released, and are free to flow inside and outside of the cell, creating “capacitive currents”.
Importantly for electrophysiology acquisition systems, cables are capacitors too; imagine a cable containing two wires. These wires are conductive, and are separated by a thin layer of insulation. These wires will separate or release charge depending on the electric potential difference between them.

Neuronal output: Action Potentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Input signals to the neuron can trigger the opening of voltage-dependent Na+ ion channels, greatly increasing membrane permeability to Na+. Following the Goldman equation above, increased permeability to Na+ will increase the relative influence of the equilibrium potential of Na+, because Na+ ions will flow through the open channels until their electrical and chemical driving forces are balanced. Na+ will follow its concentration and electrical gradient and flow from the extracellular fluid, where the Na+ concentration is high, to the inside of the cell, where Na+ concentration is low and the intracellular medium has a lower potential (Kandel, Schwartz, & Jessel, 2000).

In neurons, voltage-sensitive Na+ channels are usually concentrated at the initial segment of the axon, and it is therefore more likely that an action potential will be generated there, rather than in other regions of the cell. The subsequent opening of K+ channels begins the process of returning the membrane potential to resting conditions (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1939). This localisation is important for extracellular electrophysiology, as it means that the location of the electrode tip relative to the axon initial segment will influence the exact shape of the recorded action potential (see below).

Neuronal input: Postsynaptic potentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The action potential lasts around 1-2 ms. Extracellular recordings also pick up many slower signals of lower frequency, usually called ‘local field potentials (LFP)’ if measured intracellularly. These signals are thought to be largely generated by postsynaptic potentials, occurring over longer timescales (10s of ms) than the action potential. This allows more opportunity for signals from multiple cells to summate and result in larger signals.

Extracellular measurements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When we perform extracellular recordings, we are measuring the electric potential induced at the electrode (abbreviated to Velectrode or Vec ) by ionic currents. Vec will depend on the magnitude, sign and location of the current sources, and on the conductivity of the extracellular medium (Buzsaki et al., 2012; Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006). The effect of current on the Vec diminishes with distance, depending on how well the extracellular fluid conducts electricity.

Extracellular action potential waveforms usually last on the order of 1-2 ms, and are in the range of tens to hundreds of microvolts in amplitude, with the largest potential deflections being detected close to the soma of a neuron. These stereotypical temporal deflections of the electric potential in the extracellular space are called action potentials or spikes. Fig 5 depicts the (modelled) time-varying extracellular potential measured at 3 different locations close to a neuron. Each extracellular waveform results from the superposition of ionic and capacitive transmembrane currents. The peaks in the potential waveforms correspond to the current (right column) that is dominant at that time-point: the first positive peak of the waveform is attributed to the positive capacitive current resulting from the strong Na+ current entering the axon initial segment; the main negative peak is attributed to the influx of Na+; and finally, the second positive peak results from repolarising K+ current flowing out of the cell (Gold et al., 2006). As the effect of a current decreases with distance, the relative position of the electrode determines the relative contribution of each current and therefore the net overall current shape (left column). For instance, if the electrode is close to the axon initial segment (where many voltage-dependent Na+ channels are), the Na+ current will be larger.

.. figure:: ../static/images/electric_potential_spike.png

    **Electric potential generated by current sources in a conductive volume. The extracellular potentials and currents are adapted from Gold et al., 2006. The shape of the extracellular potential waveforms at various spatial positions 're' (marked with black dots) are simulated for a CA1 pyramidal neuron. Currents: simulated net membrane current (first column) across the soma and proximal dendrites that best estimates the extracellular potential waveform and membrane current components in terms of Na+, K+ and capacitive currents (second column). In the soma, the positive capacitive current coincides with the larger Na+ current. At locations along the apical trunk, the initial capacitive peak becomes visible. In dendritic compartments the membrane depolarisation is initially driven by Na+ current from the soma, until local Na+ currents are activated and the action potential regenerates. In the brief time before the local Na+ currents activate, the positive capacitive current is the dominant membrane current and a capacitive-dominant phase is visible in the net current (Gold et al., 2006, adapted by Joana Neto).**
